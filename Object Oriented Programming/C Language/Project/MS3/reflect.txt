1.	This milestone required you to create additional functions that were not specified or provided for you. Briefly describe three functions you created and include the purpose and value those functions contributed towards the application. Organize your answer for each function by first including the function prototype (not the definition) followed by your explanation.
A1. I have created several functions which helped me a lot as their functionalities were used a lot in the whole code. Those functions are:
(i)sortByDate:
Prototype: void sortByDate(struct Appointment* appoints,int max);
	This function helps in sorting the array of the appointments using the comparison logic of date as well as time. This function was at two points in the array, one where the view scheduled appointments was called and another where all the appointments were to be displayed. This function returns the value by reference as a pointer is passed to it for the array for appointments.
(ii) stringToInteger
Prototype: int stringToInteger(char string[]);
This function is created as this function was were handy in the code and was used at several instances in the clinic.c as the fields sometimes are inputted as string and needed to be converted to integers as done in the import functions where I had to read the code line by line and got a string for which contained an integer.
(iii) checkDate
int checkDate(struct Date* date,int year, int month, int day);
This function was used a lot many times in the code as this function was used to check two date and took the input of a pointer to the variable of type Date and compared that to the other integer corresponding values.

2.	The "addAppointment" function must perform many operations. How many lines of code did you use for this function? How many lines did you save by applying pattern recognition and the use of functions? Identify all the sections of logic you were able to consolidate into useful functions to help with readability and maintainability of the code. (Minimum: 200 words)
A2. In the function, add appointment, there were a lot of basic and generic commands and operations which I had made functions for and could increase the readability of the program. Also there are a lot of features of that function which are used again and again in the program. I saved approximately a hundred lines of codes. The function which I used were inputIntPositive(), this function ensured that the user gives a positive integer keeps on asking for input until it gets one and then it return it. findPatientIndexByPatientNum(), this function iterated the the array which contained the date for patients and returned the index of that data in the array if it was present and -1 if not. inputDate(), this function get the date from the user according the constraints like considering leap year and the uneven number of days in each month which would have taken a lot of time as well as repetitions, inputIntRange(), this function takes the input which falls in the range of its parameters and returns the passed value , checkDate(), this check the date with another date which is provided in the second, third and fourth arguments simple integers and returns an appropriate value.

3.	This milestone demanded a concerted effort in time management to insure you could complete the work on-time. Breakdown how you spent your week of development and include each function/section of logic you worked on describing the overall success/challenges you had along the way. (Minimum: 200 words)
A3. Indeed this workshop demanded a lot of time management skills without which this could not have been completed on time. Firstly, I cleared all my concepts for file handling and practised all the concepts thoroughly which would help me to implement that further in the milestone and also helped me to learn various new things which I would not have learnt otherwise that what is the difference between fgets and fscanf. Then I created a to do list for the tasks that are to be achieved and needed to be completed in order for it to work and also some points which needs to be taken care of for successfully creating this milestone. This included what are all the functions that are to be made and how a function’s output would serve for the code ahead of it. After this was done, I had a plan for what all was to be done in a sequential manner. I created the import functions which a kind of preliminary functions for the running of the code as the input was to be given to the arrays and after that, I created all the other functions which were relatively less trickier like addAppointment, removeAppointment and others.

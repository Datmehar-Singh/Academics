A1.There are several advantages of using structures in this workshop. They are-
(i)Using structures eliminated the use of techniques like parallel arrays as now whole of the information was encapsulated into a single data type for a single column of the parallel array.
	For eg-
		    struct PlayerInfo p1 = {0, 'a', 0};
    		    struct GameInfo g1 = {0, 0};

Instead of using this, we can also use parallel arrays which can store the information but this is more convenient and easy to maintain.

(ii)Another advantage of using structures is that the data is more organised than its counterparts, as it only stored the data of a player and its corresponding game data (Shown in the example above).

A2. If we want to store the history of games played then there are two major changes that we need to add to my code. They are-
(i)	First of all we need to create a separate data structure for the combined value. This data structure will include the object of both PlayerInfo and GameInfo. This way, we can make the code more readable although a bit more complex.
This can be like this
struct PlayerInfo{…};
struct GameInfo{…};

struct CombinedInfo {struct PlayerInfo playerInfo; struct GameInfo gameInfo;};


(ii)	Another major change can be making an array or storing this information in a text file using the concept of file handling which can make this code have a memory for the previous games that we have played.

A3. The thing which I was stuck on was the part on how to print the array using a void pointer. Although an array could have been printed using a simple for loop of creating two separate functions (one for int array and other for char) but I needed to refine my knowledge about void pointer so that took a bit of my time but eventually I was able to figure that out.
